# Modeling and Simulating Roulette

## Overview
The aim of this project is to model the game of roulette using monte carlo simulation in R. This was part of the Data Science Modeling and Simulation Capstone Project at Loyola University Chicago. The goal is to explore the earnings distribution of Roulette across several factors: Using one or two balls on each turn, and using various betting strategies such as the Martingale and Labouchere system.

## Reflection
The biggest challenge for this project was navigating the logic behind simulating Roulette, along with graceful error handling when monte carlo simulations would reach 1000 automations. It was here that I learned the importance of verifying code correctly runs the first time, so that each following iteration is also isolated and kept clean from the other processes.

## Future Work
Explore all possible betting strategies, and compare expected earnings across all of them to find the best method
